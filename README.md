# TraceIdentification
This is the R package for the manuscript "Recognize the little ones: UAS-based in-situ fluorescent tracer detection". The manuscript version is labeled with a tag `manuscript_01` and later improvements may be added to this repository.

The package contains functions in order to train, fit and predict from directed acyclic graph-support vector machines (DAG-SVM) with RGB image data. Additionally, the package contains a function in order to retrieve centroid coordinates of patches from (classified) images.
