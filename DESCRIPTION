Description: This package provides functions in order to identify fluorescent traces
  in high-resolution aerial images (e.g. taken with an unmanned aerial system). This package
  is used in order to analyse data for the publication Teickner et al (2019): Recognize the 
  little ones: UAS-based in-situ fluorescent tracer detection. doi: ... . The package supports
  defining and tuning support vector machines or alternatively directed acyclic graph-support vector
  machines in order to classify aerial images. It helps classifying a set of images, identifies
  patches of these traces and computes centriods of the respective pixel coordinates.
